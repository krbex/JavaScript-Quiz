JavaScript Quiz
 
This project presented itself as much less difficult than it was. While there was a lapse in my knowledge from the time spent between using CSS and js, I was able to make the site look the way I intended it to incorrectly. I also ran into unexpected problems in my javascript file, specifically somewhere in my click events.

When selecting an answer it cleared the correct choice and did not clear the incorrect choice, resulting in the timer decreasing even when tied to a correct event listener, and increasing in the amount of time lost each time. My solution was to add time on a correct answer to counteract this but I am ultimately dissatisfied with this approach and will rework it at a later date.

I felt mostly satisfied with my javascript file structure however time was my worst enemy this week and I look forward to when I can tackle this project again.

Despite this, the acceptance criteria did not call for initials and scores to be able to be recalled and only stored, which will be considered a quality of life update and applied as soon as possible.
